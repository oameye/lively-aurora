        My research focuses primarily on driven-dissipative few-body physics. Specifically, I apply Floquet perturbative expansions to interacting bosonic systems to extract non-equilibrium stationary states (NESS). The fluctuations of these NESS can then be analyzed using linear response theory. Given more noise we need to consider the optimal transition paths between two NESS in driven-dissipative systems.
